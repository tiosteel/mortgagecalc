# Getting Started

Welcome to the educational CAP on TypeScript monorepo project - Mortgage calculator.

It contains these folders and files

Workspaces | Purpose
---------|----------
`database/` | Package @mortgagecalc/database for the shared domain model and data. Important: see the build config in root folder of the project. Reason: artifacts generated by services must be deployed as well.
`app/` | content for UI frontends goes here
`packages/foundation` | package @mortgagecalc/foundation contains shared cds (including i18n - for this at least an empty index.cds is required) and classes
`srv/calculator` | package @mortgagecalc/calculatorservice contains the service which is responsible for only mortgage calculations
`srv/site` | package @mortgagecalc/siteservice contains the service for the site UI

Every CAP package has the standard structure, following CAP recommended project layout:

File or Folder | Purpose
---------|----------
`app/` | content for UI frontends goes here
`database/` | your domain models and data go here
`srv/` | your service models and code go here
`package.json` | project metadata and configuration
`readme.md` | this getting started guide
